Javascript and text files that are imported into the _bitburner_ game. I use the bitburner vscode extension to automatically 'push' or import the files into the game in real time.

## Documentation

Documented guides and help pages that I created while playing the _bitburner_ game.

- [/docs](/docs)

Dev Diary of my incremental progress through each iteration or 'soft reset'. Includes my lessons learnt in javascript programming and gameplay strategy learnt while playing the game. 

- [/docs/diary](/docs/diary)

I want the diary to help my self-learning and track my progress as I understand more advanced gameplay mechanics and unlock new features in the game; and to track my progress learning javascript programming because I feel I learn and can recall what I have learnt better when I have to clarify, describe and refine my thoughts in writing.
