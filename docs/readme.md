## Developer Diary

See my [Developer Diary](diary/readme.md) of incremental progress through each iteration or 'soft reset'. Includes my lessons learnt in programming and some gameplay strategy learnt while playing the game.

As _bitburner_ has an unstructured open gameplay **I expect** that I will make mistakes or incorrect assumptions that **will result in** less effective or slower progress through the game. **I expect that** if **I try** rapid small code experiments, _even if they are incorrect_ or **actually result in** outcomes that I did not expect, that **I will learn** and adapt quickly, more frequently.

You will see several repeated keywords emphasized in my documentation. These keywords help me structure my thoughts in a experimental or scientific method:

**I believe that** the format and structure of my documentation itself will change and adapt over time as I learn what format best helps me structure my thoughts and recall what I have previously learnt.

## Hypothesis Statement

> **I believe that** \<creating or doing some thing><br/>
> **will result in** \<some outcome>.
>
> **I will know that I am successful when I see** \<this specific measureable or metric value that I expected>.

## TEAL Cycle

- **Try**: What did I try?
- **Expect**: What did I expect?
- **Actual**: What was the actual result? What actualy happened?
- **Learn**: What did I learn after reflecting on the expected and actual outcome?
