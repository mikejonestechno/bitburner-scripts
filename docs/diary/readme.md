# Developer Diary

A dev diary of my incremental progress through each iteration or 'soft reset'. Includes my lessons learnt in javascript programming and gameplay strategy learnt while playing the game.

I want the diary to help my self-learning and track my progress as I understand more advanced gameplay mechanics and unlock new features in the game; and to track my progress learning javascript programming because I feel I learn and can recall what I have learnt better when I have to clarify, describe and refine my thoughts in writing.
