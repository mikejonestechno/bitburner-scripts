## Try

- I will try coding in vscode instead of the in-game editor.
- I will try creating structured documentation of my notes and learnings using markdown text files, and publish them to a personal GitHub repo.
- I will try to anlayze the server stats at the start of the game to optimize a basic script (e.g. running `weaken()` four times in a row on multiple threads was wasteful and time consuming when the server was close or already at low security).
- I will try to focus on automated scripts instead of earning skill and money through work and passive hacknet income because its too easy to level up too quickly.

## Expect

- I expect coding in vscode will allow me to take advantage of additional VScode features, autocomplete, intellisense, and make fewer coding mistakes than using the in-game editor (even though the in-game editor has similar autocomplete intellisense experience).

- I expect creating and structuring my thoughts in markdown will help me learn and track my progress, giving me a sense of acheivement when I can reflect back on where I started from. I expect the structure and format of the documentation will also adapt and improve over time.

- I expect analyzing the servers at the start will me create a more optimized script because the basic CLI commands dont return the money available on each server or stats about which commands will be most effective against each server.

- I expect avoiding the passive skill and income will force me to learn some of the intermediate functions and APIs that the game makes available, and help me understand some of the mid-game strategy.
