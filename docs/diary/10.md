After leaving bitburner running in background I discovered multiple contract files on _n00dles_. And after opening / runing the contract, found at least three that had reasonably simple logic. The result was hundreds of millions of dollars from three contracts. 

I learnt that finding and solving contracts can be very profitable early game. I should create experiement to determine when and how to automate contracts for early profit.

Completing coding contracts can earn reputation with current or all factions, or reputation with a company (if I have a job), or just earn money.
