## Objective 

Given that I have successfully setup Remote API file sync with the bitburner-official/typescript-template, I have decided to take the plunge to start learning Typescript instead of Javascript.

The typescript-template project README has a link to [Learn more about Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) including a page for the [new programmer](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html) that suggests Typescript is just Javascript with added benefits of a static type checker to catch syntax errors and other common mistakes that Javascript allows without throwing an exception.

In simple terms, Typescript is Javascript. With added error checking. Let's try it!

## Try

Clear the `src` directory and start over gradually converting scripts to Typescript files.

## Expect

I expect a lot of rework to make Typescript files and not sure whether previous work will be throw away. 

## Actual

So far, so good. I have created `util/log.ts` and only required minor changes to explicitly declare type mappings.

It seems Typescript may be easier to pick up than I expected.

``` javascript
javascript
export const logLevel = {
    DEBUG: 4,
    INFO: 3,
    WARN: 2,
    SUCCESS: 1.1,
    ERROR: 1,
    NONE: 0,
};
export function log(ns, message, level = "DEBUG") { ... }
```


``` typescript
typescript
export const logLevel: {[index: string]: number} = {
    DEBUG: 4,
    INFO: 3,
    WARN: 2,
    SUCCESS: 1.1,
    ERROR: 1,
    NONE: 0,
};
export function log(ns: NS, message: string, level = "DEBUG") { ... }
```


## Learn

I've started learning Typescript. No additional thoughts yet.
