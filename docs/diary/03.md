I do not know whether it would be more effective to run one grow script with 8 threads or two grow scripts with 4 threads.

## Try

- I will try to create a startup script to automate level up to hacking level 5.
- I will try to create a worm script to nuke and replicate scripts to servers.

## Expect

- I expect to hardcode some values to the initial startup to minimize RAM use and maximize effectiveness.

- I expect it would be more effective to run multiple parallel scripts with fewer threads because if one hack fails the others may succeed.

## Actual

TBC

## Learn
