I've created a script to get to hacking level 5 - which unlocks the _sigma-cosmetics_ server although due to the early 50% hack chance its not guaranteed to reach level 5 within two minutes of play.

_sigma-cosmetics_ has very similar money, security and RAM to _foodnstuff_ but has double the (admittedly low) growth rate, so as soon as we reach level 5 we should start to switch target from _foodnstuff_ to _sigma-cosmetics_.

I believe the intermediate mid term strategy is to create some form of message bus where a monitoring controller spawns jobs in a queue and server agents poll for jobs to execute as soon as they have available RAM. I'm not sure whether a low weight agent on each host is feasible or more effective than a central controller.

I believe the long term strategy is to create some form of predictive model to forecast the most effective use of resources ahead of time, and predict the timing and acurate distribution of the jobs to maximize available cpu on each host.
