# 02: Opening Gameplay Update

I have a `start.js` to scan and analyze all hackable targets at the current hacking level and target the server with highest hacking income per second.


## Try 

I will experiment to explore whether the impact of spending money to buy cracks rather than manually programming them.

### Iteration 6: Hacking Skill 49, $1.759m

Switch back to sigma-cosmetics but we are still at lower rates $135/sec.
At hacking level 50 I can manually program BruteSSH.exe

## Learn

Without spending money on cracks or purchasing servers I have learnt that even unlocking level 30 (hong-fang-tea)
and level 40 (harakiri-sushi) that I dont immediately gain higher income rates because the hack time is twice as long
and only 50% chance of success.

Analyzing _neo-net_ at level 51 (_neo-net_ is hackable from level 50) shows that a hack will take **3 minutes** with a 33% hack chance, an income of $1/second.

While I can spend money to buy cracks and unlock servers that need port cracking, I will be significantly losing my income rate.

At the very start increasing hacking level **did** unlock higher level servers and **one** round of significantly higher income. 

However subsequent hacking level and unlocking servers that need port cracking **did not** result in higher income rates.

I need to explore the growth mechanics and start purchasing additional servers to grow back what I have stolen right at the start. All servers start with 4% of their max Money. I need to keep this increasing AND keep weakening the servers so that I get and maintain at least 80% hack chance.
