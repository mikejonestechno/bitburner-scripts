# Terminology

## Bitburner Terminology and Definitions (from Bitburner)

NUKE.exe: a virus that will grant root access if there are enough open ports

backdoor: allows you to connect directly to a server even if it is not adjacent to your current server.

In bitburner you purchase _servers_ from Alpha Enterprises, and the netscript functions refer to servers. 

hacknet: a global decentralized network of annonymous machines for distributed cyber attacks. In bitburner each machine is called a _node_.
Note: the 'hack' refers to this being dedicated to running hacks but I think it could be better referred to 'darkbotnet' to emphasize its annonymous like the 'dark net' or 'tor net'.

## General Terminology (from GPTChat)

malware: any malicious software e.g. virus, worms, trojan horse, ransomware, adware, spyware are all types of malware.

virus: malicious software designed to replicate and spread. A virus typically requires some form of human intervention (such as opening an email attachment or downloading a file) to infect a computer.

worm: malicious software designed to replicate itself and spread AUTOMATICALLY. A worm does NOT need human intervention and can spread through vulnerabilities in operating systems, networked computers, or other applications.

distributed network: a network in which multiple computers work together to perform tasks or share resources.

decentralized network: a network with no central server or authority such as _peer-to-peer_ networks.

grid computing system: a type of distributed network used to perform large-scale parallel processing tasks, typically too resource-intensive for a single machine to handle on its own.

cloud network: a distributed network that use the internet to provide computing resources and services on demand.

botnet: a network of compromised computers that are controlled remotely by an attacker. The attacker typically gains control of the computers in a botnet by installing malware that allows them to remotely control the machines. The computers in a botnet are often referred to as "zombie computers" because they are controlled by the attacker without the knowledge or consent of their owners.

cryptojacking: use of a botnet to perform cryptocurrency mining (without knowledge or consent of the computer owners).

shared memory parallel processing: In shared memory parallel processing, multiple processors or computers share a common memory space, allowing them to access and communicate with each other directly.

distributed memory parallel processing: In distributed memory parallel processing, each processor or computer has its own memory space, and communication between processors is done through message passing.

hybrid parallel processing: Hybrid parallel processing combines elements of shared memory and distributed memory parallel processing, allowing processors to communicate both directly and through message passing.

sharding: a method of distributing data across multiple servers or machines in order to improve performance and scalability. Data is divided into smaller pieces, or shards, which are each stored on a separate server or machine. This allows the data to be processed and accessed in parallel, rather than sequentially. There are several different approaches to sharding, including key-based, range-based, hash-based and directory-based sharding.

ChatGPT: "tell me the pros and cons of different approaches to sharding"

multithreading: a technique in which a single process is broken up into multiple threads that can be executed concurrently on a computer with multiple processors or cores.

multiprocessing: a technique in which multiple processes are executed concurrently on a computer with multiple processors or cores. Each process is executed in its own memory space and has its own set of resources, allowing it to be executed independently of other processes.

node: a point of connection in a computer network, can be a computer, switch or router.

server: a computer that provides resources or services to other computers (clients).
host: a computer that can communicate with other computers over a network, can be a server or a client.
