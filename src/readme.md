# Source files

Typescript, javascript and text files that are imported into the _bitburner_ game.

> ⚠️ This is my working repository of scripts and documentation created while playing the _bitburner_ game. 🚧 Work in progress. 🏗️

Not much to see here yet but will be populated over time as I progress and play through the game.

## VScode

I use the official bitburner [`typescript-template`](https://github.com/bitburner-official/typescript-template/blob/main/DockerGuide.md) project running in a docker container to automatically 'push' or import the files into the game in real time. The official remote API is not a two-way sync so files added or edited using the in-game editor are not synced back to vscode, but files added or edited in vscode will auto import into the game.
